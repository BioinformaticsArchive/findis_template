Ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal, 3 (CLN3) was originally described as juvenile-onset form (JNCL), with onset between 4 and 10 years of age. With the identification of molecular defect, the CLN3 refers to CLN caused by mutation in the CLN3 gene, regardless of the age at onset.

<br/><br/>

The classic autosomal recessive form of CLN3 (JNCL) is characterized by visual failure, epileptic seizures, and loss of cognitive and motor functions. The onset of the disease is usually between 4 and 10 years of age, and the lifespan is 18-35 years. Variant forms of CLN3 disease, with slower protracted disease progression, and one case with infantile onset, have also been described.

<br/><br/>

CLN3 is caused by mutations in the Ceroid-lipofuscinosis, neuronal 3 (CLN3) gene, which is located in 16p12.1. CLN3 was the first gene underlying human NCLs to be discovered. The pathogenic mechanism, however, is still unclear. CLN3 encodes a hydrophobic transmembrane protein and has been shown to localize in Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, synaptosomes and cell membrane.
