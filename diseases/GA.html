Gyrate atrophy is an inherited amino acid disorder of ornithine metabolism leading to slowly progressive visual loss and blindness. The basic defect is deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine aminotransferase OAT encoded by a gene at chromosome10q26. This leads to increased amount of ornithine in plasma and cellular compartments. The pathogenetic pathways from increased ornithine accumulation to chorioretinal degeneration is not known. The major clinical problem of the patients is a slowly progressive loss of vision leading to blindness usually by the fifth decade of life. Myopia and decreased night vision are early symptoms, usually noted before the end of first decade. Reduced peripheral vision with construction of visual fields is obvious in the second decade. 

 <br/><br/>

Virtually all patients develop posterior subcapsular cataracts late in the second decade or early in the third. This combination of the cataracts and constricted visual fields may result in severe impairment of vision during the third decade. By the fourth to fifth decades most patients are blind. The changes in the ocular fundus parallel the development of the visual symptoms. Sharply demarcated, circular areas of chorioretinal degeneration are present in the midperiphery of the ocular fundus at early stages of the disease. 

 <br/><br/>

At around the time of puberty, the retinal degeneration seems to accelerate. The lesions enlarge, coalesce and extent toward the posterior pole of the fundus. In older patients, there is complete chorioretinal degeneration. A few GA patients have additionally mild proximal muscle weakness. 

<br/><br/>

Nearly all patients have histologic abnormalities in type 2 fibers of skeletal muscles. Plasma ornithine values of GA patients are 10 to 20 -fold increased ranging from 400 to 1400 microM and 0.5 to 10mM of ornithine is excreted daily in urine allowing diagnosis of patients with apropriate ocular findings. A gene test is available in families or populations with known OAT mutations.
